INTERPRET:

1. Cluster 0 is too economic but they rich we can name it by "economical people that has enough money to buy things". we can offer them some discount but because they already a bit old maybe the offer is something related to hobby like books and something relaxing to them. also discount of membership
2. Cluster 1 still same but this one is more economical we can called "the economist sharks" we can offer them a long lasting product like massage chair, or a bike. make discount 
3. Cluster 2 young blood but they not too spending alot we can call it "The economist young blood" since they still young they still havent much experience, this time i can offer them something that might they havent tried before... like sky diving maybe or traveling offer in things maybe
4. Cluster 3 is bit same so we can call "Expensive Young Sharks" we can offer them anything related they spend on mall, even it didnt get discount
Here i have recomendation, maybe you can add married variabel because with that it will make easier to know their needs... most young parent are need baby needs too so we can give it discount
